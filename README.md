I created this calculator to meet my frequent need to perform the following tasks in my work:
1. Perform coordinate conversions, such as from geocentric to geodetic.
2. Plan the next coordinate from the initial target coordinate based on the distance/azimuth/elevation from the target coordinate.

I hope you find this calculator as useful in your work as it has been in mine.
