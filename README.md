I created this calculator due to the frequent need in my simulation work to:
<br>i) Perform coordinate conversions, such as from geocentric to geodetic,
<br>ii) Plan the next world coordinates according to the WGS84 standard, based on inputs for distance (in kilometers) and bearings.

I hope you find this calculator as useful in your work as it has been in mine.
