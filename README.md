I created this calculator out of a frequent necessity in my simulation work to perform coordinate conversions, such as from geocentric to geodetic. Additionally, the tool aids in planning the next world coordinates according to the WGS84 standard, utilizing inputs for distance (in kilometers) and bearing. 

This project stems from my own professional needs but is designed with the broader community in mind. I hope you find this calculator as useful in your work as it has been in mine.
